Today is the last day spent @Haufe. And I must admit, this summer internship was simply awesome. My work colleagues were so friendly, they helped me when I was in trouble. And I didn't thought it's so fun to go to work.

Below, is a screenshot of the application we built during this intership at Haufe. It's a feedback box app, built with the Meteor framework. Meteor is a brand new framework, both front-end and back-end, which makes Meteor a great framework.

The developing process whas a little bit tricky for us, because it was the first time we used Meteor to develop web apps. But, in the end, we proved that nothing is impossible, and if you truly want, you can learn new things anytime.
