To support software development and IT-operations in the cloud, Microsoft has now launched two very interesting programs worldwide. The objective is to help software developers and IT-professionals learn how to use cloud services for their everyday computing needs and to do so with Microsoft products like Microsoft Azure. Even if you're not the biggest fan of Microsoft technologies, you may want to take advantage of these programs to learn how to perform your Dev and your Ops with cloud technologies: it's a very generous offer. 
 
Microsoft's first Program [Microsoft IT Pro Cloud Essentials](https://www.itprocloudessentials.com/) enables you to sign up to the "Cloud Essentials" program, and subscribers to this program get to use Microsoft's Azure cloud platform services free of charge. With the subscription, Microsoft also makes available online courses, workshops and even Microsoft certifications - also free of charge. The program homepage is at [Microsoft IT Pro Cloud Essentials](https://www.itprocloudessentials.com/) and the German info video is [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/germany/2016/06/13/it-pro-cloud-essentials-und-career-center/?wt.mc_id=DX_59340).

Microsoft's second program, [Microsoft IT Pro Career Center](https://www.itprocareercenter.com/), is designed to help you understand how you can build your career by mastering these cloud technologies. By signing in, Microsoft provides you with a set of tools to assist you in finding out what you need to know to grow your career.
