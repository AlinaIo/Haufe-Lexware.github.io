### Overview

I developed a proof-of-concept project to test the feasibility of the following features:

- Log in to an ASP.NET application using the Haufe AFDS identity.
- In the application, perform specific operations depending on the user's membership in certain groups (e.g. only allow access to function **x** if the user is a member of group **y**).
