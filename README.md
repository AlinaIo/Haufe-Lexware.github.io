## Contributing

Pull Requests from our design, development and operations teams of [Haufe.Group](http://www.haufe-lexware.com) and its subsidiaries are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before we are more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

If you find bugs or issues you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/Haufe-Lexware.github.io/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.
